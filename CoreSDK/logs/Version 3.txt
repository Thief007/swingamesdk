SwinGame Software Development Kit
Version 3


Suggestions:
* Close/Open Window (forum)
* Group Apply (cw)
* Change Movement to dx,dy ? (cw)
* - Add SpriteVelocity -> Vector
* - SetSpriteVelocity(Vector) or (x,y)
* - SpritePosition -> Point2D
* - SetSpritePosition(Point2S) or (dx,dy)
* - SpriteSpeed -> float
* - SpriteHeading -> float (angle)
* Change window title (forum)
* Polygon type+drawing, matrix operations (translate + scale), collisions
* Load resources from stream (eg. zip files of resources)
* Sprite BB kind (circle, box, polygon)
* sgUIControls - button, textarea, label, progress bar, dialog, inc/dec, file list
* status bar
* SwinGame Map Editor

** New to Version 3 **
  General:
  - Commented functions in API
  
  Audio:
  - Added ability to fade music in and out. FadeMusicIn, FadeMusicOut
  
  Camera:
  - added ToScreen
  - added CameraPos
  
  Resources: new unit
  - added GetResources functions and procedures
  - added new Map resource procedures to map names to resources
  - added get resources by name
  - added release resources by name
  - added loading of resource bundles
  
** Changes to Version 2 **
  Units renamed:
    SGSDK_Audio -> sgAudio
    SGSDK_Camera -> sgCamera
    SGSDK_Core -> sgCore
    SGSDK_Graphics -> sgGraphics
    SGSDK_Input -> sgInput
    SGSDK_Physics -> sgPhysics
    SGSDK_Shapes -> sgShapes
    SGSDK_Font -> sgText
    SGSDK_MappyLoader -> sgTileMap
    
  Moved all type declarations into sgTypes
  
  Audio changes:
  - Loops changes to be the number of times played, rather than the number of
    times repeated. PlaySoundEffect(x, 2) now plays twice not three times
  - Playing Music no longer calls StopMusic, though only one music can be playing at a time..
  
  Core changes:
  - Removed HasSpriteCollidedX, HasSpriteCollidedY
  - Removed PosX, PosY from Sprite.
  - Removed Colour, and all associated functions - standardised to use Color
  - Moved GetResource procesures to sgResources
  
  Text changes:
  - Changed order of parameters in TextWidth and TextHeight
  
  Input changes:
  - renamed IsKeyPressed to KeyDown
  - renamed WasKeyTyped to KeyTyped
  - renamed AKeyWasPressed to AnyKeyPressed
  - renamed IsMouseDown and IsMouseUp to MouseDown and MouseUp respectively
  - renamed MouseWasClicked to MouseClicked
  - renamed IsMouseShown to MouseShown
  
  KeyCode changes:
  - renamed keycodes ie VK_BLAH to vk_BLAH (lots!) + some new codes + formatting/comments update
    Note: this now uses SDL key codes rather than windows specific codes now.
  
  Physics changes:
  - default bitmap/sprite collision now using pixel level collisions
  - renamed GetUnitVector to UnitVector
  - renamed GetUnitVector to UnitVector
  - renamed GetVectorFromAngle to VectorFromAngle
  - renamed MultiplyVector to VectorMultiply
  - renamed Multiply to MatrixMultiply
  - renamed CalculateVectorFromTo to VectorFromTo
  - renamed PointToVector to VectorFromPoint
  - renamed CalculateAngleBetween to CalculateAngle
  - renamed LimitMagnitude to LimitVector
  - renamed VectorIsWithinRect to VectorInRect
  - renamed RectangleHasCollidedWithLine to RectLineCollision
  - renamed IsZeroVector to VectorIsZero
  - renamed HasSpriteCollidedWithRect to SpriteRectCollision
  - renamed HasSpriteCollidedWithBitmap to SpriteBitmapCollision
  - renamed bounded (params) to bbox (or BBox in method)
  - renamed HasBitmapCollidedWithRect with BitmapRectCollision
  - renamed HasBitmapPartCollidedWithRect to BitmapPartRectCollision
  - renamed VectorFromPointToRectangle to VectorFromPointToRect
  - renamed CircleHasCollidedWithLine to CircleLineCollision
  - renamed VectorCollision (was renamed to CircleCollision)
  - renamed CircleCollisionWithLine to CollideCircleLine
  - renamed CircularCollision to CollideCircles
  - renamed Magnitude to VectorMagnitude
  
  Camera changes:
  - renamed XOffset and YOffset methods to CameraX and CameraY respectively
  - renamed GameX and GameY method to WorldX and WorldY respectively
  - renamed MoveVisualArea (overloaded) methods to MoveCameraBy
  - renamed SetScreenOffset (overloaded) methods to MoveCameraTo
  - renamed FollowSprite (overloaded) methods to CenterCameraOn
  - renamed ToWorldCoordinates and ToScreenCoordinates to ToWorld and ToScreen respectively

// The Types unit contains the data types used by SwinGames for shapes,
// Sprites, Bitmaps, Sounds, etc.
//
// Change History:
//
// Version 3.0:
// - 2010-01-13: Aaron  : Changed function pointer of ShapeDrawingFn to accept offset
// - 2009-12-18: Andrew : Moved to new sprite format.
// - 2009-12-15: Andrew : Updated animation handling to use new NamedIndexCollection.
// - 2009-12-10: Andrew : Added cell details to bitmap
// - 2009-11-06: Andrew : Changed to Sound and Music Data records
// - 2009-10-16: Andrew : Changed to consistent array names TypeArray eg. Point2DArray
//                      : Added shapes and shape prototypes
// - 2009-07-13: Clinton: Renamed Event to MapEvent to MapTag
//                      : Renamed EventDetails to MapTagDetails
//                      : Renamed LayerData to MapLayerData
//                      : Renamed Tile to MapTile
//                      : Renamed CollisionData to MapCollisionData
// - 2009-07-06: Andrew : Changed movement to velocity and x,y to position for Sprite 
// - 2009-07-03: Andrew : Added sameas attribute to allow implicit casts in C#
// - 2009-07-02: Andrew : Formatting, added @via_pointer for types accessed via a pointer
//                      : Added fields to meta comments for Vector
// - 2009-06-29: Andrew : Added Circle
// -                    : Started Polygon (removed for version 3)
// - 2009-06-20: Andrew : Created types unit.

First run SGSDKVB6.reg.

Open up "VB6 Starter Pack.vbp" and rename it to what ever you want.
Add your code into "GameLogic.bas".

Compiling your game
In VB6 under the file menu there is the option make "Insert project name here".exe.
This will create an executable. Once you have created an executable, run "copyresources.cmd".
This will create a bin folder with your game inside it.

For the game to run on another computer you must first run SGSDKVB6.reg on it.

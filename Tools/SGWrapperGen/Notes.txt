-- SGWrapperGen Meta Comments --

 ====================================
 = Library and Module Meta Comments =
 ====================================


/// @lib
/// @lib name

All functions/procedures in SwinGame headers must have @lib.
If the function/procedure is overloaded in Pascal this must be given a unique name (/// @lib name).

This defines the name of the function/procedure in SGSDK.dll


/// @sn name:%s blah:%s

This maps the Pascal name to Objective C, sn = special name
Format has one %s per parameter.
This is needed if there is more than one parameter in the fn/proc.


/// @doc_idx 1

This orders the documentation for overloaded functions. Put a low number for the easy to use versions, and higher numbers for special cases. For example, easy to use fill rect with x, y, w, h so doc_idx 1


/// @param name comment

Add a comment for the parameter with the given name


 ===============================
 = Class Related Meta Comments =
 ===============================

/// @class SoundEffect

This associates the method with a class in the wrappers. After this the next comments are associated with this class


/// @dispose

This is the destructor for the object.


/// @constructor

This creates the object (must be a function that returns a pointer to the new object)


/// @getter name
/// @setter name

Defines a property. getting must have a single parameter (the object) and return the value. Setter must have 2 parameters, one object and one value.


/// @self 1

Indicates the position of the self parameter for the method. Defaults to 1.


/// @method Play

The name of the method, can only be once for overloaded methods.


/// @overload Play PlayWithLoops

The overloaded name of the method, for languages that dont support overloaded methods. First value is method overloaded, second is a unique name for this method if overloads not supported.


/// @csn initWithName:%s fromFile:%s

The Objective C version of the method. One %s per parameter for the method ( = one less than method | = same number for constructors [must be init...] )


 ==================================
 = Old comments not really needed =
 ==================================

/// @uname PlaySoundEffectWithLoop

This use is no longer needed... was there for use with /// @lib call_other(params)


/// @doc_detail

No longer used
